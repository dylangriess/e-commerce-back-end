## Description

> The motivation for this project was creating a back end for an e-commerce site.
> I built this project to learn how to better use Express and Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.
>
> I learned how to connect routes in order to make calls and retrieve related products, and how their relationships between each other connect.

## Installation

## Usage
